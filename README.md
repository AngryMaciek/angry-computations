## Advanced methods for efficient scientific computing in Python/R/C++

The following software repository presents a specialised,
postgraduate-level monographic course dedicated to efficient scientific computing.
Its main focus are the interfacing mechanisms between langauges widely used and popular
amongst data scientists: _Python_ and _R_ to a low-level but much faster _C++_.

### Scope & target audience üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

(general info: HOW, not WHAT)

Participants of the course should be well-prepared with:

* reasonable experience with a text shell environment
* very good understanding of C and C++
* basic programming skills in Python and R
* background in: linear algebra, real analysis, statistics and machine learning

In addition to the aforementioned material prior experience in
computational research will be highly beneficial.

For the reasons above the following course **is not** suitable for junior developers.  

### Structure üèóÔ∏è

The course is divided into 5 sessions with session zero dedicated to
setting up necessary dependencies.
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E

(how-to go through it, structure description)
